# Voice of the Community
This is a mod that adds new custom items to the game, all from the ideas of the Official Skul Discord!

## PLEASE BE AWARE!!!
This project is a variation of MrBacanudo's [Custom Items mod](https://github.com/MrBacanudo/SkulHardModeMods/tree/main/CustomItems).
None of the code belongs to me excluding content related to custom items.

## Content
This mod contains:

* 5 Commons
* 9 Rares
* 4 Uniques
* 3 Omens
* 5 Legendaries

Please keep in mind, the mod doesn't gurantee that your game will be 100% fine.
Use this at your own risk. Here be dragons!
