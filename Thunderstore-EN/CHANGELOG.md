And thus, the Flask of Botulism lives another day.

Changes:
- 'Mana Accelerator' now has the inscriptions [Manatech / Mana Cycle] instead of [Manatech / Artifact]
- 'Flask of Botulism' now reduces 0.01 seconds of poison tick rate instead of 0.1 seconds
- Changed the description of 'Blood-Soaked Javelin'

There seems to be not much feedback anymore, so it might be time to say farewell.
Y'know, wouldn't it be super anti-climatic if there was a critical bug and I need to update the mod again?
... Please no.
