This is a mod that adds new custom items to the game, all from the ideas of the Official Skul Discord!

## PLEASE BE AWARE!!!

**DO NOT USE THE KOREAN AND ENGLISH VERSION TOGETHER; IT WILL MALFUNCTION!!!**

This project is a variation of MrBacanudo's [Custom Items mod](https://github.com/MrBacanudo/SkulHardModeMods/tree/main/CustomItems).
None of the code belongs to me excluding content related to custom items.

## Content
This mod contains:

* 5 Commons
* 9 Rares
* 4 Uniques
* 3 Omens
* 5 Legendaries

## Thunderstore
The mod is now published on Thunderstore! Go and check it out!

## Manual Installation
BE AWARE that this installation method is ripped off directly from [MrBacanudo's SkulHardModeMods](https://github.com/MrBacanudo/SkulHardModeMods/tree/main).

1. Download the external dependencies
    * BepInEx (Windows x64): https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.21/BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip
    * Unstripped Core Libraries: https://unity.bepinex.dev/corlibs/2020.3.34.zip
    * Unstripped Unity Libraries: https://unity.bepinex.dev/libraries/2020.3.34.zip
2. Extract all files into the Skul folder
    * Default is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skul` or `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Skul`
      * You can find this by right clicking Skul on Steam -> Properties -> Local Files -> Browse
    * BepInEx must be extracted to the game's root folder (i.e. you must see `winhttp.dll` and `doorstop_config.ini` in that folder)
    * The other two must be extracted inside the `2020.3.34` folder (the same folder!)
3. Edit the new `doorstop_config.ini` file inside the game folder:
    * Change the last line from `dllSearchPathOverride=` to `dllSearchPathOverride=2020.3.34`
4. Download the mods! Latest one here: https://github.com/damku1214/VoiceOfTheCommunity/releases/latest
5. Put the mods you want into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder inside your game folder
    * You're allowed to mix or just use what you want!

Please keep in mind, the mod doesn't gurantee that your game will be 100% fine.
Use this at your own risk. Here be dragons!
